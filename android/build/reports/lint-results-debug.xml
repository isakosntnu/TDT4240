        id="DataExtractionRules"
        severity="Warning"
        message="The attribute `android:fullBackupContent` is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules` specifying an `@xml` resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher."

        priority="3"
        summary="Missing data extraction rules"
        explanation="Before Android 12, the attributes `android:allowBackup` and `android:fullBackupContent` were used to configure all forms of backup, including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.&#xA;&#xA;In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute `android:dataExtractionRules`, specifying an `@xml` resource that configures which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device transfers, separately. If your `minSdkVersion` supports older versions, you&apos;ll still want to specify an `android:fullBackupContent` resource if the default behavior is not right for your app."
